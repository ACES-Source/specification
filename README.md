# Tokenized Protocol Specification

Reference for the Tokenized Protocol structure. Definitions are stored in YAML to be parsed and compiled to other languages. Definitions are grouped by their purpose and are versioned within.

The Tokenized Protocol must retain the entire definition history in order to parse legacy messages from prior versions. The working version for each definition is `develop`. Previous versions are stored in a directory that specifies that release version, for example, `v0001`.

## Definitions

### Protocol

All actions related to the Tokenized Protocol.

### Assets

All asset payloads for the Asset related message actions.

### Messages

All asset messages for the Message related message actions.
