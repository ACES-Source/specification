  name: Amendment
  description: "An Amendment is used to describe the modification of a single field in a Contract opr Asset, as defined in the ContractFormation and AssetCreation messages."
  notes: "Header, timestamp, and \"count\" fields that are generated or managed by the Smart Contract are included in the index of fields for consistency, although they cannot be modified on request, or in the case of a \"count\" field, there are expectations such as the count matching the number of elements in the related field. An example of a \"count\" field is VotingSystemCount in a ContractFormation, which specifies the number of VotingSystems. Indexes are zero based."

fields:
  - name: FieldIndex
    label: Field Index
    description: "Index of the field to be amended."
    type: uint8
    size: 1
    example_hex: 02
    example_value: 2
    notes: "A field with a complex array type uses the same FieldIndex value for all elements. For example, in C1 the VotingSystems field is FieldIndex 16. Indexes are zero based."

  - name: Element
    label: Element
    description: "Specifies the element of the complex array type to be amended. This only applies to array types, and has no meaning for a simple type such as uint64, string, byte or byte[]. Specifying a value > 0 for a simple type will result in a Rejection."
    type: uint16
    size: 2
    example_hex: 0000
    example_value: 0
    notes: "To specify the 3rd VotingSystem of a Contract, the value 2 would be given. Indexes are zero based."

  - name: SubfieldIndex
    label: Subfield Index
    description: "Index of the subfield to be amended. This only applies to specific fields of an element in an array. This is used to specify which field of the array element the amendment applies to."
    type: uint8
    size: 1
    example_hex: 01
    example_value: 1
    notes: "For example to specify the 2nd field of a VotingSystem, value 1 would be given."

  - name: DeleteElement
    label: Delete Element
    type: bool
    description: "1 = remove the element listed in the Element field, 0 means this is not a delete operation. The DeleteElement field only applies to a particilar element of a complex array type. For example, it could be used to remove a particular VotingSystem from a Contract."

  - name: Data
    label: Data
    description: "New data for the amended subfield. Data type depends on the the type of the field being amended."
    type: byte[]
    notes: "The bytes should be in an format appropriate for the field being modified."
