    label: Vote Type
    description: "R - Relative Threshold, A - Absolute Threshold, P - Plurality,  (Relative Threshold means the number of counted votes must exceed the threshold % of total ballots cast.  Abstentations/spoiled votes do not detract from the liklihood of a vote passing as they are not included in the denominator.  Absolute Threshold requires the number of ballots counted to exceed the threshold value when compared to the total outstanding tokens.  Abstentations/spoiled votes detract from the liklihood of the vote passing.  For example, in an absolute threshold vote, if the threshold was 50% and 51% of the total outstanding tokens did not vote, then the vote cannot pass.  50% of all tokens would have had to vote for one vote option for the vote to be successful. Plurality means the most favoured option is selected, regardless of the number of votes cast or the percentage relative to other choices."

  - name: ThresholdPercentage
    label: Threshold Percentage for the Voting System
    description: "This field is ignored when VoteType is P (Plurality). Otherwise it is the percentage of ballots required for a proposal to pass. Valid values are greater than 0 and less than 100. 75 means 75% and greater.  Only applicable to Relative and Absolute Threshold vote methods.  The Plurality vote method requires no threshold value (NULL), as the successful vote option is simply selected on the basis of highest ballots cast for it."
