  name: Amendment
  description: "An Amendment is used to describe the modification of a single field in a Contract or Asset, as defined in the ContractFormation and AssetCreation messages."
  notes: "Header, timestamp, and count fields that are generated or managed by the Smart Contract are included in the index of fields for consistency, although they cannot be modified on request, or in the case of a count field, there are expectations such as the count matching the number of elements in the related field. An example of a count field is VotingSystemCount in a ContractFormation, which specifies the number of VotingSystems. Indexes are zero based."

fields:
  - name: FieldIndex
    label: Field Index
    description: "Index of the field to be amended."
    type: uint
    size: 1
    example_hex: 02
    example_value: 2
    notes: "A field with a complex array type uses the same FieldIndex value for all elements. For example, in C1 the VotingSystems field is FieldIndex 16. Indexes are zero based."

  - name: Element
    label: Element
    description: "Specifies the element of the complex array type to be amended. This only applies to array types, and has no meaning for a simple type such as uint64, string, byte or byte[]. Specifying a value > 0 for a simple type will result in a Rejection."
    type: uint
    size: 2
    example_hex: 0000
    example_value: 0
    notes: "To specify the 3rd VotingSystem of a Contract, the value 2 would be given. Indexes are zero based."

  - name: SubfieldIndex
    label: Subfield Index
    description: "Index of the subfield to be amended. This only applies to specific fields of an element in an array. This is used to specify which field of the array element the amendment applies to."
    type: uint
    size: 1
    example_hex: 01
    example_value: 1
    notes: "For example to specify the 2nd field of a VotingSystem, value 1 would be given."

  - name: Operation
    label: Operation
    type: uint
    size: 1
    description: "0 = Modify. 1 = Add an element to the data to the array of elements. 2 = Delete the element listed in the Element field. The Add and Delete operations only apply to a particilar element of a complex array type. For example, it could be used to remove a particular VotingSystem from a Contract."
    example_hex: 00
    example_value: 0

  - name: Data
    label: Data
    description: "New data for the amended subfield. Data type depends on the the type of the field being amended."
    type: varchar
    size: 32
    notes: "The bytes should be in an format appropriate for the field being modified."
