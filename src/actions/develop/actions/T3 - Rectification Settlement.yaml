# Rectification Settlement Action: Settles a transfer (T1) request that was originally accepted, but
# the transfer transaction had inputs that spent UTXOs that were also spent by other transactions,
# and the conflicting UTXO spends confirmed, which prevented the original settlement (T2)
# transaction from confirming in a block. Since the smart contract agent is the single source of
# truth, the settlement is "finalized" as soon as it is created, so if it doesn't confirm in a block
# then the ledger is not up to date. This action repairs the ledger. The conflicted settlement
# action contains the original transfer showing the authorizations for the transfer and the original
# settlement data.
