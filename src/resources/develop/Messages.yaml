    # A message that is meant to signal intent or specify an offer to another party (PKH).  The offer can be for a token, or for a static contract.  An offer is effectively a message with no signatures on it, and may have non-standardized communication.  "I'd like to offer you 1000 BCH for your shares in Apple."  It can be the start of a negotiation.  Likely done in a private manner after establishing a secure (DH) communication channel.

      name: Offer

    # A partially signed transaction or a Payment Request.  Useful for sending transactions that require multiple signatures from different contracting parties such as in the case of bitcoin multisig txns and exchange (token) actions. Also useful for static contract formation.  The Payment Request can be sent along with an Invoice.  The Invoicee can use the Payment Request to actually make the payment.

Certain types of messages can be excluded, and most importantly the minimum threshold value that must be sent in order to avoid being considered spam.  Different threshold amounts can be applied to different types of messages.  The Public Key (RSA) can also be declared here.
