    description: >
      Required field to specify the decimal precision of a currency. It will normally be the
      "precision" value associated with the CurrencyCode. It is the number of decimal places between
      the number of tokens and the common unit of measure. For example, in AUD, the common unit is
      the dollar, but a token would only be worth a penny. So the precision should be 2 for the two
      decimal places in a dollar amount "$1.00". In this scenario 100 tokens are worth $1.
