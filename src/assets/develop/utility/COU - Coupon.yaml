  - name: Precision
    label: Precision
    type: deprecated
    description: >
      Deprecated for new Currency Value type. Required field to specify the decimal precision of a
      currency. It will normally be the "precision" value associated with the Currency. It is the
      number of decimal places between the number of tokens and the common unit of measure. For
      example, in AUD, the common unit is the dollar, but a token would only be worth a penny. So
      the precision should be 2 for the two decimal places in a dollar amount "$1.00". In this
      scenario 100 tokens are worth $1.
