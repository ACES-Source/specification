# T1 - Send Action

code: T1

metadata:
  name: Send
  label: Send Action
  description: "A Token Owner Sends a Token to a Receiver. The Send Action requires no sign-off by the Token Receiving Party and does not provide any on-chain consideration to the Token Sending Party. Can be used for User Revocation (remove tokens from wallet by sending back to Issuer). Can be used for redeeming a ticket, however, it is probably better for most ticket use cases to use the exchange action for ticket redemption."

The Asset Type can be the leading bytes - a convention - to make it easy to identify that it is a token by humans."
