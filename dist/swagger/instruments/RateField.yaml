      Required field to specify the decimal precision of the value. It will normally be the 
      "precision" value associated with the Currency. It is the number of decimal places between  the
      number of tokens and the common unit of measure. For example, in AUD, the common unit is  the
      dollar, but a token would only be worth a penny. So the precision should be 2 for the  two
      decimal places in a dollar amount "$1.00". In this scenario 100 tokens are worth $1.
