type: object
properties:
  Address:
    description: The address receiving the tokens
    type: string
  Quantity:
    description: Number of tokens to be received by address at Output X
    type: number
    example: 100
  OracleSigAlgorithm:
    description:  >
      0 = No Oracle-signed Message (OracleConfirmationSig skipped in serialization), 1 =
      ECDSA+secp256k1. If the contract for the asset being received has oracles, then a signature is
      required from one of them.
    type: number
    example: 1
  OracleIndex:
    description:  >
      Specifies the index into the list of oracles in the contract offer that was used to authorize
      this transfer.
    type: number
  OracleConfirmationSig:
    description:  >
      Length 0-255 bytes. If restricted to a oracle (whitelist) or has transfer restrictions (age,
      location, investor status): ECDSA+secp256k1 (or the like) signed message provided by an
      approved/trusted oracle through an API signature of the defined message. If no transfer
      restrictions(trade restriction/age restriction fields in the Asset Type payload. or restricted
      to a whitelist by the Contract Auth Flags, it is a NULL field.
    type: string
