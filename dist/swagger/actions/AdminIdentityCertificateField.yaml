description:  >
  A certificate provided by an identity oracle to verify the administrator address is associated 
  with the issuer entity identification information. Also if a contract operator is provided then it
  verifies that the contract operator address is associated with the specified contract  operator
  identity information. For a child contract that references a parent entity contract the certificate
  verifies that the administrator address is associated with that entity contract.
