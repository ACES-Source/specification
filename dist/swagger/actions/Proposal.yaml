  ProposedAmendments:
    description:  >
      Each element contains details of which fields to modify, or delete. Because the number of
      fields in a Contract and Asset is dynamic due to some fields being able to be repeated, the
      index value of the field needs to be calculated against the Contract or Asset the changes are
      to apply to. In the event of a Vote being created from this Initiative, the changes will be
      applied to the version of the Contract or Asset at that time.
