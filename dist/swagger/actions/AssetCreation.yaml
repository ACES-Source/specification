  Action.
type: object
properties:
  AssetCode:
    description:  >
      A unique code that is used to identify the asset. It is generated by hashing the contract
      public key hash and the asset index. SHA256(contract PKH + asset index)
    type: string
    example: "0e6996402ea456156838652e3bd82c6c0986ef7925021d31f3d397bdcdd985fe"
  AssetIndex:
    description:  >
      The index of the asset within the contract. First asset is zero, second is one. Used to derive
      the asset code.
    type: number
    example: 0
  AssetPermissions:
    description:  >
      A set of permission objects containing switches and field references that define the
      permissions for modifying this asset. See the Permission documentation for more detail.
    type: string
    example: "151c232a31383f464d545b626970777e858c939aa1a8afb6"
  TransfersPermitted:
    description:  >
      Set to true if transfers are permitted between two parties, otherwise set to false to prevent
      peer-to-peer transfers.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  EnforcementOrdersPermitted:
    description:  >
      Set to true if the administration is permitted to make enforcement orders on user tokens and
      balances, otherwise set to false to disable this feature.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  VotingRights:
    description:  >
      When false holders of this asset will not be able to vote for tokens of this asset even on
      voting systems in which vote multiplers are not permitted.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  VoteMultiplier:
    description:  >
      Multiplies a vote by the specified integer. Where 1 token is equal to 1 vote with a 1 for vote
      multipler (normal), 1 token = 3 votes with a multiplier of 3, for example. If zero, then
      holders of this asset don't get any votes for their tokens.
    type: number
    example: 3
  AdministrationProposal:
    description:  >
      Set to true if the administration is permitted to make proposals outside of the smart contract
      scope.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  HolderProposal:
    description:  >
      Set to true if a holder is permitted to make proposals outside of the smart contract scope.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  AssetModificationGovernance:
    description:  >
      Supported values: 1 - Contract-wide Asset Governance.  0 - Asset-wide Asset Governance.  If a
      referendum or initiative is used to propose a modification to a subfield controlled by the
      asset permissions, then the vote will either be a contract-wide vote (all assets vote on the
      referendum/initiative) or an asset-wide vote (only this asset votes on the
      referendum/initiative) depending on the value in this subfield.  The voting system specifies
      the voting rules.
    type: number
    example: 1
  TokenQty:
    description:  >
      The number of tokens to issue with this asset. Set to greater than zero for fungible tokens. If
      the value is 1 then it becomes a non-fungible token, where the contract would have many assets.
      Set to 0 to represent a placeholder asset, where tokens are to be issued later, or to represent
      a decomissioned asset where all tokens have been revoked.
    type: number
    example: 1000000
  AssetType:
    description: A code representing the type of asset and the structure of the payload.
    type: string
    example: "CUR"
  AssetPayload:
    description:  >
      A custom payload that contains meta data about this asset. Payload structure and length is
      dependent on the asset type chosen. See asset documentation for more details.
    type: string

    type: number
    example: 1594668650000000000

    description:  >
