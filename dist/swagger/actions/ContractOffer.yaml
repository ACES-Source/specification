  Allows the administration to tell the smart contract what they want the details (labels, data,
  T&C's, etc.) of the Contract to be on-chain in a public and immutable way. The Contract Offer
  action 'initializes' a generic smart contract that has been spun up by either the smart contract
  operator or the administration. This on-chain action allows for the positive response from the
  smart contract with either a Contract Formation Action or a Rejection Action.

  ContractName:
    description:  >
      Can be any unique identifying string, including human readable names for branding/vanity
      purposes. Contract identifier (instance) is the bitcoin public key hash address. If the public
      address is lost, then the administration will have to reissue the entire contract, Asset
      Definition and tokens with the new public address. Smart contracts can be branded and
      specialized to suit any terms and conditions.
    type: string
    example: Tesla - Shareholder Agreement
  BodyOfAgreementType:

  BodyOfAgreement:
    description:  >
      SHA-256 hash of the body of the agreement (full contract in pdf format or the like) or the full
      terms and conditions of an agreement in the Tokenized Body of Agreement format.  This is
      specific to the smart contract and relevant Assets.  Legal and technical information.

  GoverningLaw:
    description:  >
      5 Letter Code to identify which governing law the contract will adhere to.  Disputes are to be
      settled by this law in the jurisdiction specified below. Private dispute resolution
      organizations can be used as well.  A custom code just needs to be defined.
    type: string
    example: USA
  Jurisdiction:

      Legal proceedings/arbitration will take place using the specified Governing Law in this
      location.
    type: string

  ContractExpiration:
    description:  >
      All actions related to the contract will cease to work after this timestamp. The smart contract
      will stop running.  This will allow many token use cases to be able to calculate total smart
      contract running costs for the entire life of the contract. Eg. an issuer is creating tickets
      for an event on the 5th of June 2018.  The smart contract will facilitate exchange and send
      transactions up until the 6th of June.  Wallets can use this to forget tokens that are no
      longer valid - or at least store them in an 'Expired' folder.
    type: number
  ContractURI:
    description:  >
      Points to an information page that also has a copy of the Contract.  Anyone can go to the
      website to have a look at the price/token, information about the issuer (company), information
      about the asset, legal information, etc.  There will also be a way for token owners to vote on
      this page and contact details with the issuer/tokenized companies. Could be a IPv6/IPv4, or
      txn-id for on-chain information or even a public address (DNS).
