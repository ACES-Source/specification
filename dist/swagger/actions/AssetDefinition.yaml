  This action is used by the administration to define the properties/characteristics of the asset
  (token) that it wants to create. An asset has a unique identifier called AssetID = AssetType +
  base58(AssetCode + checksum). An asset is always linked to a contract that is identified by the
  public address of the Contract wallet.

  AssetPermissions:
    description:  >
      A set of permission objects containing switches and field references that define the

    type: boolean
    example: true
  VoteMultiplier:
    description:  >
      Multiplies a vote by the specified integer. Where 1 token is equal to 1 vote with a 1 for vote
      multipler (normal), 1 token = 3 votes with a multiplier of 3, for example. If zero, then
      holders of this asset don't get any votes for their tokens.
    type: number
    example: 3
  AdministrationProposal:
    description:  >
      Set to true if the administration is permitted to make proposals outside of the smart contract

  AssetModificationGovernance:
    description:  >
      Supported values: 1 - Contract-wide Asset Governance. 0 - Asset-wide Asset Governance.  If a
      referendum or initiative is used to propose a modification to a subfield controlled by the
      asset permissions, then the vote will either be a contract-wide vote (all assets vote on the
      referendum/initiative) or an asset-wide vote (only this asset votes on the
      referendum/initiative) depending on the value in this subfield.  The voting system specifies
      the voting rules.

    example: 1
  TokenQty:
    description:  >
      The number of tokens to issue with this asset. Set to greater than zero for fungible tokens. If
      the value is 1 then it becomes a non-fungible token, where the contract would have many assets.
      Set to 0 to represent a placeholder asset, where tokens are to be issued later, or to represent
      a decomissioned asset where all tokens have been revoked.
    type: number
    example: 1000000
  AssetType:
    description: A code representing the type of asset and the structure of the payload.
    type: string
