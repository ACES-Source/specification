description:  >
  A message that contains all of the details required for an agreement to be formed. Sent to an
  address(es). The Offer should have all, or nearly all, of the details required for the receiving
  party to accept the offer.  The Offer shall be in the form of a partially formed Bitcoin
  transaction with all of the relevent details (offer, consideration, offeror's payment/receipt
  details, etc.).  The Offer message is different to a Signature Request message in that it is
  missing the offeree's payment/receipt details (eg. UTXOs). If the Offer message is well received by
  the offeree, then the offeree can add their relevent details (eg. inputs/outputs) and sign the
  transaction.  If an additional signature is required from the offeror at this point, then the
  partially-signed transaction can be sent to the offeror by way of a Signature Request message.
