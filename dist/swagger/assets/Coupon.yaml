  Precision:
    description:  >
      Required field to specify the decimal precision of a currency. It will normally be the
      "precision" value associated with the Currency. It is the number of decimal places between the
      number of tokens and the common unit of measure. For example, in AUD, the common unit is the
      dollar, but a token would only be worth a penny. So the precision should be 2 for the two
      decimal places in a dollar amount "$1.00". In this scenario 100 tokens are worth $1.
